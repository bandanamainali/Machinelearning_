### Save model using Pickle
Pickle allows you to serialize machine learning models in their existing state, making it possible to use them again as needed. In this section, we will learn to serialize a machine learning model with Pickle. Great! The parameters of the model we just unpickled are the same as the one we initially created.


# what is serialization in python ??
Serialization is the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream or a string representation that can be easily stored or transmitted. The serialized form preserves the object's structure and internal data. In Python, the built-in pickle module provides the functionality to perform serialization.
