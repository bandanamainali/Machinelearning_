# H1  Multiple variable linear regression

## H2  Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. In this technique, we use a linear equation to represent the relationship between the variables. The equation can be written as

Y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bnxn

Where:

Y is the dependent variable
X1, X2, …, Xn are the independent variables
b0, b1, b2, …, bn are the coefficients of the independent variables
Multiple linear regression is a powerful tool for predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. It is widely used in various fields such as finance, economics, and social sciences.

### plotting for Multiple Linear Regression Model

When working with multiple linear regression, it is essential to visualize the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This can help you identify any patterns or trends in the data and understand how the independent variables affect the dependent variable.

To plot for multiple linear regression, we will be using Matplotlib, which is a popular data visualization library in Python. Matplotlib provides various functions to create different types of plots, including scatter plots, line plots, and bar plots.

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

### Step 2: Load the Data

### Step 3: Create the Scatter Plot

### Step 4: Add the regression Line

### Step 5: Add Multiple Independent Variables
